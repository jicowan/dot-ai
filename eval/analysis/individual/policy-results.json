(2) **Technical Excellence**: Mastery of modern CEL validation, comprehensive schema analysis including edge cases (ephemeral containers), and efficient single-iteration workflow completion. (3) **Consistent Quality**: Lowest variance (consistency score 0.98) with rankings #1-3 in all scenarios - never falling below acceptable thresholds. (4) **Production Performance**: Response times (3-37s) and token efficiency (140K-165K) suitable for enterprise interactive workflows. (5) **Risk Profile**: Zero catastrophic failures, no context limitations, no timeout issues - deployable with confidence across all policy generation scenarios.

Models with <100% participation (Gemini Pro 75%, DeepSeek/Mistral/GPT-5-Pro 50%) pose unacceptable production risks regardless of peak performance.

(3) **Performance Variance Indicates Instability**: Models with high score variance (Grok-4-fast: 0.05-0.795) demonstrate unstable reasoning unsuitable for predictable production workflows. (4) **Architectural Tradeoffs Are Scenario-Dependent**: Speed specialists (Claude Haiku) excel in simple scenarios but fail in complex ones; reasoning models (DeepSeek) provide quality when applicable but have catastrophic coverage gaps. (5) **Modern Validation Literacy Separates Tiers**: CEL-based validation with has() checks and all() iterators is table stakes - pattern-matching approaches (Claude Haiku: 0.565-0.65 in complex scenarios) cannot enforce numeric constraints properly. For enterprise Kubernetes policy management, only 2 models meet production reliability standards (Claude Sonnet, Gemini Flash), while 4 models pose catastrophic operational risks (GPT-5-Pro, DeepSeek, Mistral, Grok-4-fast). Organizations must prioritize 100% scenario participation and <0.1 score variance for production deployment confidence."

      "comment": "Three critical patterns emerged: (1) **Context length is a hard constraint** - DeepSeek Reasoner and Mistral Large failed completely due to 131K limits vs 138-140K required, making them unsuitable for schema-heavy policy scenarios. (2) **Modern CEL validation outperforms legacy pattern matching** - top performers (Claude Sonnet, Gemini Flash, Grok-4, GPT-5) all used CEL with has() checks and all() iterators, while Claude Haiku's pattern matching was less precise and performant. (3) **Efficiency varies dramatically** - token consumption ranged from 134K (Grok-4) to 687K (Grok-4-fast-reasoning), with Claude Haiku at 556K suggesting architectural inefficiency. (4) **Ephemeral container coverage separates good from great** - only Claude Sonnet, Gemini models, and GPT-5 validated ephemeral containers (critical for debugging scenarios). (5) **CRD awareness is emerging** - several models (Claude Sonnet, Gemini models, Grok-4) included CNPG Cluster, though technically incorrect for pod-level policies - shows promising CRD analysis but needs refinement. (6) **Reliability failures are catastrophic** - GPT-5-Pro's 15-minute timeout represents unacceptable production risk. (7) **Cost-performance tradeoffs** - Gemini 2.5 Flash offers best value with 87% score at 37s and 165K tokens, while Gemini 2.5 Pro's 79% score at 110s/332K tokens shows diminishing returns. (8) **Workflow consistency matters** - single-iteration completion (Claude Sonnet, Gemini Flash) demonstrates superior prompt understanding versus multi-iteration refinement. For production Kubernetes policy management, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Gemini 2.5 Flash emerge as clear leaders with strong quality, modern validation approaches, reasonable performance, and crucially, reliable completion. Models with context limitations (DeepSeek, Mistral) or reliability issues (GPT-5-Pro) are unsuitable for enterprise policy scenarios requiring comprehensive schema analysis.",

      "comment": "This evaluation reveals critical architectural requirements for Kubernetes policy generation: (1) **Context Window Size**: Models with <140K token limits (deepseek-reasoner, mistral-large-latest) cannot handle comprehensive schema-aware policy generation, resulting in complete failure. (2) **Technical Correctness**: Proper CEL-based validation is essential - pattern-based validation (claude-haiku) cannot enforce numeric comparisons. The best models (gemini-2.5-pro, claude-sonnet, grok-4) use CEL with has() checks and >= operators. (3) **HA Enforcement Depth**: Only gemini-2.5-pro and grok-4 properly enforce >= 2 replicas; others either check existence only or use > 0, failing to meet true HA requirements. (4) **Output Format Reliability**: Format compliance is critical - grok-4-fast-reasoning generated correct logic but failed due to markdown wrapping, highlighting the importance of production-ready output formats. (5) **Performance vs. Quality Trade-offs**: Gemini-2.5-flash offers the best performance (11.8s) with acceptable quality, while gemini-2.5-pro provides superior quality at 48.9s - organizations must balance latency requirements against policy correctness. (6) **Resource Coverage**: The best models identified 4-6 relevant resource types (core controllers + CNPG custom resources); incomplete schema analysis led to missing critical resources (gpt-5 excluded CNPG Cluster). (7) **Cost-Performance**: For production enterprise use requiring high correctness, gemini-2.5-pro offers the best value despite higher latency. For high-throughput scenarios with basic validation needs, gemini-2.5-flash provides optimal efficiency.

      "comment": "This evaluation reveals stark differences in model suitability for organizational policy intent management:\n\n**Performance Clusters**: Three distinct tiers emerged: (1) Fast responders (Haiku, Mistral <2s) offering production viability, (2) Moderate performers (Sonnet, Grok-4-fast, Gemini-Pro 3-30s) acceptable for interactive use, and (3) Slow/failed models (Deepseek 167s, Grok-4 94s, GPT-5-Pro timeout) unsuitable for real-time policy workflows.\n\n**Quality vs. Speed Trade-off**: Deepseek and Gemini-Pro achieved highest technical precision but at severe performance cost. Claude Haiku demonstrated optimal balance - 80%+ quality at 1.3s response. This suggests that for policy intent management, 'good enough fast' outperforms 'perfect slow' in production environments.\n\n**Scope Interpretation Variance**: Models diverged significantly on synonym breadth: (1) K8s-purists (Grok-4, Gemini-Pro) provided precise API objects, (2) Cross-platform models (GPT-5, Haiku) included cloud equivalents, (3) Over-inclusive models (Gemini-Flash) added architectural concepts. For organizational policy trigger matching, cross-platform breadth (Haiku approach) is most valuable.\n\n**Reliability as Disqualifier**: GPT-5-Pro's complete failure and Grok-4's 94s latency demonstrate that unreliable models are non-viable regardless of quality. Policy workflows require consistent sub-30s responses. Timeout tolerance must be strict for production policy management.\n\n**Token Efficiency Gap**: Massive variance in output tokens (14-4,423) for equivalent tasks signals different reasoning approaches. Deepseek's 4,423 tokens and GPT-5's 2,496 tokens for simple lists indicate inefficient internal processing. This impacts both cost and latency.\n\n**Best Practice**: For production organizational policy intent management, prioritize Claude Haiku (speed + breadth) for initial policy creation, Gemini-Pro (precision) for compliance-critical validation, and avoid unreliable/slow models entirely. Cost-effective policy workflows require <5s response times with 70%+ quality threshold.",

Top performers (Claude Haiku, Mistral Large, Claude Sonnet) demonstrate the critical combination of speed (<3s response), comprehensive technical coverage (workloads + enforcement mechanisms + QoS classes), and token efficiency needed for production policy workflows. The clear winners prioritize both breadth (workload types) and depth (enforcement mechanisms like admission controllers, limit ranges, QoS classes). Mid-tier models (Gemini Pro, Grok-4-fast, GPT-5, Grok-4) show acceptable technical knowledge but suffer from either insufficient depth or performance issues. Bottom-tier models (Gemini Flash, Deepseek Reasoner, GPT-5-Pro) are fundamentally unsuitable for production policy management due to catastrophic performance failures - response times ranging from 30 seconds to 15+ minutes are unacceptable for interactive policy workflows. A critical insight: comprehensive technical coverage of enforcement mechanisms (admission controllers, QoS classes, limit ranges) separates expert-level policy models from basic resource enumeration. For organizational policy management, teams should prioritize models with sub-5-second response times, explicit enforcement mechanism coverage, and token efficiency under 150 tokens for this task type. The timeout failures highlight that reasoning-heavy models may be inappropriate for interactive policy workflows where responsiveness is paramount.",
