Claude Haiku 4.5 emerged as the efficiency leader in single-resource scenarios, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 proved most reliable for sustained, multi-resource workflows. The evaluation exposes critical failure modes including HTTP timeouts (Mistral Large, GPT-5 Pro), rate limiting (DeepSeek), and workflow abandonment (GPT-5, Grok variants), highlighting that many models optimize for individual response quality at the expense of workflow completion reliability.",

While Claude Haiku technically achieved higher scores in participated scenarios (0.8987 avg), its catastrophic failure in the comprehensive auto-scan (25% failure rate, 0.730 reliability score) disqualifies it from primary production recommendation.

Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated production-grade capability, while 7 models failed catastrophically via timeouts (5 models), API errors (1 model), or rate limiting (1 model). Claude Sonnet 4.5 emerged as the clear winner with optimal balance of technical accuracy (92%), efficiency (88%), and reliability, completing the full workflow in 384s with 1.09M tokens. Gemini 2.5 Flash provided exceptional technical depth but at slightly lower token efficiency (962K tokens, 1246s). The 70% failure rate highlights the importance of workflow completion testing for comprehensive capability analysis scenarios - many models showed strong individual response quality but catastrophic failure in sustained, multi-resource analysis. GPT-5-Pro and GPT-5 showed particularly poor performance (8 and 13 completions respectively), while Grok-4 came closest to success (66/67) but still failed at the critical final step. For production Kubernetes capability inference requiring reliable completion of 50+ resource analyses, only Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Gemini 2.5 variants should be considered viable options. The massive performance gap between successful models (914-878 scores) and failed models (all 0.0) demonstrates this is a binary pass/fail scenario rather than a spectrum of capability.",

The top performers (Claude Haiku, Mistral Large, Gemini Pro) demonstrate that sub-5-second response times with 200-300 output tokens can deliver production-grade Service capability analysis covering essential features like service types, traffic policies, load balancing, and multi-cloud applicability. Mid-tier models (Claude Sonnet, Gemini Flash, Grok variants) show viable alternatives with different speed-depth profiles. The bottom tier illustrates failure modes: DeepSeek Reasoner's 77-second response and GPT-5 Pro's 270-second response represent 30-100x performance degradation that eliminates practical utility regardless of technical accuracy. For Service resource analysis specifically, capabilities fall into clear priority tiers: (1) Core networking (service discovery, load balancing, traffic routing), (2) Service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName), (3) Advanced features (session affinity, traffic policies, dual-stack), (4) API-level details (traffic distribution, health check ports, IP family policies). Models that efficiently cover tiers 1-3 (Claude Haiku, Mistral Large) provide optimal value, while those pursuing tier 4 completeness (GPT-5 Pro) sacrifice usability. The evaluation also highlights provider identification as a quality signal - models recognizing 'multi-cloud' applicability demonstrate better architectural understanding than those limiting scope to 'kubernetes'.

      "comment": "This evaluation reveals stark differences in model approaches to Kubernetes capability inference: (1) **Efficiency-Quality Balance is Critical**: Claude Haiku-4 demonstrates that fast response times (7s) and concise output (542 tokens) can coexist with comprehensive, accurate capability analysis, achieving the best overall score (0.906). This proves that more tokens/time doesn't equal better quality. (2) **Over-Engineering is Counterproductive**: Models like Mistral-Large (1000+ capabilities, 17,464 tokens) and GPT-5 (73s, verbose output) demonstrate that excessive comprehensiveness reduces practical usability. The best models (Claude Haiku, Claude Sonnet) focus on primary capabilities without drowning users in implementation details. (3) **Reliability is Non-Negotiable**: GPT-5-Pro and Mistral-Large both experienced HTTP timeouts (180s limit) during semantic search operations, failing to complete workflows despite good individual analyses. This reliability failure severely impacts production viability, dropping them to ranks 9-10. (4) **Speed-Comprehensiveness Tradeoff**: A clear pattern emerges where models cluster into three tiers: fast & focused (Claude Haiku/Sonnet: 7-10s), balanced & comprehensive (Gemini models: 39s), and slow & over-engineered (GPT-5, Deepseek: 73-126s). The winning strategy is fast & focused with sufficient depth. (5) **Technical Accuracy Varies**: Top performers correctly identify 13-22 Service capabilities covering all service types, traffic policies, and networking features, while lower-ranked models provide only 6-8 basic capabilities. For Deployment, comprehensive models cover 16-26 capabilities including security contexts, volumes, and lifecycle hooks, while minimal models list only 6-7. (6) **Provider Identification Matters**: Best models correctly identify 'kubernetes' for core resources and specific storage providers (AWS EBS, Azure Disk, etc.) for volume-related capabilities, while weaker models either over-generalize ('multi-cloud') or over-specify (listing 20+ providers unnecessarily). (7) **Cost-Performance**: At typical pricing ($0.30-1.00 per 1M input tokens, $1.25-5.00 per 1M output tokens), Claude Haiku's efficiency (16K total tokens in 7s) offers exceptional value compared to Mistral's failure (30K tokens in 359s with timeout). (8) **Production Recommendations**: For production capability inference, prioritize Claude Haiku (best speed-quality-reliability), Claude Sonnet (good balance, slightly less comprehensive), or Gemini-Pro (when detailed provider mapping required). Avoid models with timeout histories (GPT-5-Pro, Mistral-Large) or excessive processing times (Deepseek: 126s). The 3-minute HTTP timeout constraint mentioned in tool context is a real production limitation that eliminates multiple models from consideration.",
