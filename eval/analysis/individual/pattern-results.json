While Claude Haiku matches the quality score with superior speed (1.4s), Sonnet's evaluation explicitly notes 'best K8s resource coverage' making it optimal for quality-critical scenarios. The key differentiator is domain expertise depth - Sonnet demonstrates superior K8s-specific understanding which correlates with better pattern management capabilities.

All top-tier models (Claude Haiku/Sonnet, GPT-5, Mistral Large) achieved perfect reliability (100% participation, zero failures) while maintaining high quality scores (0.8-0.85). The catastrophic failure of GPT-5-Pro underscores a critical production principle: theoretical capability means nothing without operational delivery. The 42x speed variance between models highlights that performance optimization must balance technical accuracy with responsiveness - Grok-4's 78.6s response time makes it operationally unsuitable despite participation. Kubernetes-specific domain knowledge emerged as a key quality differentiator - models demonstrating deep K8s resource awareness (StatefulSets, PVCs) consistently scored higher. The clear performance tiers enable precision model selection based on workload characteristics: quality-critical scenarios demand Claude Sonnet, high-volume workflows benefit from Haiku's speed, while Deepseek's severe quality issues (0.51) make it unsuitable regardless of reliability metrics. Production deployments should prioritize the top four models (Claude Sonnet/Haiku, Mistral Large, GPT-5) which combine proven reliability with strong domain expertise."

For production Kubernetes pattern management, Claude Sonnet emerges as optimal for quality-critical scenarios (best K8s resource coverage including StatefulSets), while Claude Haiku excels for high-throughput workflows requiring sub-2-second responses. The 42x speed difference between fastest (Haiku: 1.4s) and slowest successful model (Grok-4: 78.6s) underscores that model selection must balance technical accuracy with operational responsiveness.
