# PRD #75: Test Performance Analysis & Optimization Tool

**Status**: Planning  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Created**: 2025-08-22  
**GitHub Issue**: [#75](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/75)  

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Developers lack visibility into test performance bottlenecks in the dot-ai project's comprehensive test suite (845+ tests). Without automated analysis, it's difficult to:
- Identify which tests are genuinely slow vs. expected to be slow
- Understand root causes of test performance issues
- Get actionable recommendations for optimization
- Detect redundant or unnecessary tests that could be removed
- Track test performance regression over time

### Solution Overview
Create an intelligent test performance analyzer that integrates with the existing Jest test suite to provide automated analysis, insights, and optimization recommendations for test performance.

### Success Metrics
- **Performance**: Reduce overall test suite runtime by 20%+ through optimization
- **Developer Experience**: Provide clear, actionable insights in <5 minutes analysis time
- **Quality**: Maintain 100% test coverage while optimizing performance
- **Automation**: Zero manual intervention required for basic analysis

## Business Context

### User Impact
- **Primary Users**: dot-ai developers and contributors
- **Secondary Users**: CI/CD pipeline efficiency (GitHub Actions)
- **Value Proposition**: Faster development cycles, reduced CI costs, improved developer productivity

### Strategic Alignment
Supports the dot-ai project's mission of AI-powered development productivity by applying intelligent analysis to the development workflow itself.

## Detailed Requirements

### Core Functionality

#### 1. Test Performance Detection
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Default >2s for individual tests, >10s for test suites
- **Baseline Comparison**: Compare against historical performance data
- **Statistical Analysis**: Identify performance outliers and trends
- **Context Awareness**: Understand when slow tests are expected (integration tests vs unit tests)

#### 2. Root Cause Analysis
- **Common Pattern Detection**:
  - Unnecessary async/await operations
  - Missing mocks for external services
  - Redundant setup/teardown operations
  - Database/filesystem operations in unit tests
  - Large fixture loading
  - Expensive computation in test setup

- **Resource Usage Analysis**:
  - Memory consumption patterns
  - CPU-intensive operations
  - Network calls and timeouts
  - File I/O operations

#### 3. Optimization Recommendations
- **Specific Actionable Suggestions**:
  - "Mock the ClaudeIntegration API calls in test X"
  - "Move expensive setup to beforeAll instead of beforeEach"
  - "Consider using shallow rendering for component test Y"
  - "Replace real filesystem operations with in-memory alternatives"

- **Code Examples**: Provide before/after code snippets for common optimizations
- **Priority Ranking**: Sort recommendations by expected impact

#### 4. Test Redundancy Detection
- **Duplicate Test Logic**: Identify tests that verify the same functionality
- **Over-Testing**: Flag areas with excessive test coverage that don't add value
- **Obsolete Tests**: Detect tests for removed or significantly changed functionality

### Integration Requirements

#### Jest Integration
- **Custom Reporter**: Seamless integration with existing `npm test` workflow
- **Zero Config**: Works out-of-the-box with current Jest setup
- **Non-Intrusive**: No impact on test execution performance

#### CI/CD Integration  
- **GitHub Actions**: Report performance regressions in PR checks
- **Threshold Enforcement**: Fail builds if test performance degrades significantly
- **Historical Tracking**: Store and compare performance metrics over time

### Output & Reporting

üìä Summary:
  Total Tests: 845
  Slow Tests: 12 (>2s)
  Very Slow Tests: 3 (>5s)
  Potential Savings: 45s (estimated)

üêå Slowest Tests:
  1. answer-question.test.ts (23.4s) - Multiple Claude API calls without mocks
  2. schema.test.ts (17.1s) - Large fixture loading in each test
  3. build-system.test.ts (18.3s) - Real filesystem operations

üí° Top Recommendations:
  1. Mock Claude API in answer-question.test.ts (save ~20s)
  2. Use beforeAll for fixture loading in schema.test.ts (save ~12s)
  3. Use in-memory filesystem for build-system.test.ts (save ~15s)
