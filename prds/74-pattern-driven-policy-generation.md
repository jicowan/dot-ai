# PRD: Organizational Policy Management and Enforcement System

**Created**: 2025-08-20
**Status**: Draft
**Owner**: Viktor Farcic
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-21
**GitHub Issue**: [#74](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/74)

## Executive Summary

Create a comprehensive organizational policy management system that maintains policies as independent entities alongside patterns and capabilities. Policies proactively integrate with the AI recommendation workflow through enhanced question generation, ensuring users receive compliant configurations from the start rather than discovering violations after manifest rejection. This approach separates resource recommendations (patterns) from configuration enforcement (policies) while providing a seamless user experience.

## Problem Statement

**Current State**: Organizations have governance requirements that are difficult to enforce consistently across AI recommendations and direct cluster interactions. Current patterns conflate resource recommendations with configuration enforcement, creating confusion about their purpose and scope.

**Key Issues**:
- **Conflated Responsibilities**: Patterns try to serve both resource recommendation and configuration enforcement roles
- **Reactive Enforcement**: Users discover policy violations only after manifest rejection
- **No Proactive Guidance**: Policy requirements aren't presented during resource configuration
- **Manual Policy Management**: Users must separately create and maintain Kyverno policies
- **Poor User Experience**: Users hit policy walls without guidance on compliance

## Solution Overview

**Organizational Policy Management with Proactive Integration**: Create policies as independent organizational entities that integrate seamlessly with the AI recommendation workflow. Policies guide users proactively during configuration through enhanced question generation, ensuring compliance from the start.

### Core Innovation

**Clear Separation of Concerns**:
- **Patterns**: Guide resource selection ("For web apps, suggest Deployment + Service + Ingress")
- **Capabilities**: Discover what's actually available in the cluster
- **Policies**: Enforce how resources must be configured ("All Deployments must have resource limits")

**Proactive Compliance Architecture**: User Intent → Find Resources (Patterns + Capabilities) → Find Policies → Generate Policy-Aware Questions → Compliant Configuration

## Technical Architecture

### Integration Points

**Extends Existing Infrastructure**:
- **`manageOrgData` tool**: Enhanced with policy CRUD operations as new `dataType: 'policy'`
- **Question Generation**: Enhanced `generateQuestionsWithAI` includes policy search and integration
- **Schema Validation**: Leverages existing `discovery.explainResource()` for Kyverno policy validation
- **Vector DB**: Stores policy intents independently with semantic search via `PolicyVectorService`

### Two-Part Policy Model

**Policy Intent** (Stored in Vector DB):
- User-friendly description of what should be enforced
- Semantic search enables finding relevant policies during recommendations
- Guides AI to generate appropriate questions and defaults
- Independent of specific resource types (works on whatever resources are selected)

**Kyverno Policy** (Applied to Cluster):
- Generated from policy intent when enforcement is needed
- Last line of defense at Kubernetes API level
- Single source of truth for actual enforcement rules
- Referenced by name from policy intent (no duplication)

### Recommendation Integration Pipeline

```typescript
User Intent → Search Patterns → Search Capabilities → Search Policy Intents → Generate Policy-Enhanced Questions → User Answers → Compliant Manifests
```

**Quality Gates**:
1. **Pattern Search**: Finds organizational patterns matching user intent (resource suggestions)
2. **Capability Search**: Finds actual cluster resources available for deployment
3. **Policy Intent Search**: Finds policy intents applicable to the selected resources
4. **Question Enhancement**: AI incorporates policy requirements into question generation
5. **Manifest Generation**: Creates compliant manifests using policy-aware answers
6. **Optional Enforcement**: User can generate Kyverno policies from intents for cluster-level blocking

### Policy Intent Structure

```typescript
interface PolicyIntent {
  id: string;                    // Auto-generated UUID
  description: string;           // Detailed description for embedding
  triggers: string[];            // Keywords for semantic matching
  rationale: string;             // Why this policy exists  
  createdAt: string;             // ISO 8601 timestamp
  createdBy: string;             // Author identifier
  
  // Track deployed Kyverno policies (names only - no YAML duplication)
  deployedPolicies?: {
    name: string;                // e.g., "require-resource-limits-1735789200"
    appliedAt: string;           // When it was applied to cluster
  }[];
}

## User Workflows

### Policy Creation and Deployment

```
1. User provides policy description: "All containers must have resource limits"
2. AI generates Kyverno YAML from description
3. Dry-run validation against cluster to ensure policy is valid
4. User reviews generated policy and chooses:
   - Apply to cluster → policy enforced at Kubernetes level
   - Save as file → for GitOps workflows  
   - Discard → policy not used
5. System stores policy intent in Vector DB with:
   - Description, triggers, rationale (for semantic search)
   - Deployed policy names (if applied)
   - File paths (if saved)
6. Policy intent immediately available for recommendation guidance
```

### Policy-Enhanced Recommendations

```
1. User: "Deploy a web application"
2. System searches patterns → finds "web-app-pattern" suggesting [Deployment, Service, Ingress]
3. System searches capabilities → finds actual resources in cluster
4. System searches policy intents → finds "resource-limits-policy"
5. AI generates questions with policy requirements:
   - name: "Application name"
   - cpu_limit: "CPU limit (⚠️ required by resource-limits-policy)"
     default: "500m"
     hint: "Organization policy requires CPU limits"
   - memory_limit: "Memory limit (⚠️ required by resource-limits-policy)"
     default: "512Mi"
6. User provides answers → manifests are compliant from the start
```

### Policy Lifecycle Management

**Update Policy Intent**:
```
1. User updates policy description
2. If deployed policies exist → ask "Regenerate Kyverno policies?"
3. If yes → regenerate, apply to cluster, update references
```

**Delete Policy Intent**:
```
1. User deletes policy intent
2. If deployed policies exist → ask "Delete Kyverno policies from cluster?"
3. If yes → remove from cluster using stored names
4. Remove policy intent from Vector DB
```

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Separate Policies from Patterns
**Date**: 2025-08-21  
**Decision**: Policies and patterns are separate entities with distinct purposes  
**Rationale**: 
- Patterns guide resource selection ("For web apps, suggest Deployment + Service + Ingress")
- Policies enforce configuration ("All Deployments must have resource limits")
- Conflating them creates confusion and limits flexibility

**Impact**: 
- Complete architecture change from original PRD concept
- Policies become independent organizational data type
- No cross-references between patterns and policies

**Code Impact**: Remove pattern-based policy generation, create new policy management system

### Decision 2: Two-Part Policy Model
**Date**: 2025-08-21  
**Decision**: Policies exist as both intents (guidance) and Kyverno policies (enforcement)  
**Rationale**:
- Policy intents guide AI during recommendations (proactive)
- Kyverno policies enforce at cluster level (reactive)
- Same business rule expressed in two forms for different purposes

**Impact**: 
- Policy intents stored in Vector DB for semantic search
- Kyverno policies optionally generated and applied to cluster
- Clear separation between guidance and enforcement

**Code Impact**: Create PolicyIntent interface, implement policy-to-Kyverno generation

### Decision 3: Integrate with Question Generation
**Date**: 2025-08-21  
**Decision**: Policies enhance question generation rather than block manifests  
**Rationale**: Proactive compliance (users learn while configuring) is better UX than reactive rejection  
**Impact**: 
- Policies searched after resources are selected
- Policy requirements become REQUIRED questions
- Users get compliant configurations from the start

**Code Impact**: Modify `generateQuestionsWithAI`, update question generation prompts

### Decision 4: Lean Storage Strategy  
**Date**: 2025-08-21  
**Decision**: Only store policy intents and references in Vector DB, not Kyverno YAML  
**Rationale**: 
- Avoid data duplication and sync issues
- Cluster is single source of truth for Kyverno policies
- Reduces storage overhead and complexity

**Impact**: 
- PolicyIntent only tracks deployed policy names
- Kyverno YAML fetched from cluster when needed
- Simpler lifecycle management

**Code Impact**: Remove YAML storage from PolicyIntent, implement cluster-based policy retrieval

### Decision 5: No Resource Type Constraints
**Date**: 2025-08-21  
**Decision**: Policy intents don't specify which resource types they apply to  
**Rationale**: 
- Policies work on whatever resources the recommendation system already selected
- More flexible - new resource types automatically supported
- Avoids potential conflicts between resource lists and actual applicability

**Impact**: Policy search happens after resource selection, not before  
**Code Impact**: Remove `applicableResources` field from PolicyIntent interface

### Decision 6: No Prescriptive Kyverno Examples
**Date**: 2025-08-21  
**Decision**: Avoid providing specific Kyverno YAML examples that could constrain AI generation  
**Rationale**: 
- AI should use its knowledge to generate appropriate Kyverno structures per policy
- Specific examples might cause pattern-matching that fails for different policy types
- Different policies may need different Kyverno features (validate, mutate, generate)

**Impact**: 
- PRD focuses on PolicyIntent structure and workflow, not Kyverno syntax
- AI has flexibility to generate appropriate policies for each intent
- Reduces risk of generation failures due to pattern constraints

**Code Impact**: Remove Kyverno YAML examples from PRD, rely on AI's Kyverno knowledge

### Decision 7: Immediate Generation Workflow  
**Date**: 2025-08-21
**Decision**: Generate Kyverno policy immediately when user creates policy intent, store intent only after user decision
**Rationale**: 
- Simpler workflow - user sees the actual policy before committing
- Only store policy intents that weren't discarded  
- Can track deployment/save status accurately

**Impact**: 
- Policy intent stored at end of process with deployment information
- Vector DB only contains policy intents that are actually being used
- Clean lifecycle management with accurate reference tracking

**Code Impact**: Store policy intent after Apply/Save/Discard decision, include deployment status

### Decision 8: Shared Organizational Entity Architecture
**Date**: 2025-08-21
**Decision**: Create base `BaseOrganizationalEntity` interface that both patterns and policies extend
**Rationale**: 
- PolicyIntent and OrganizationalPattern share 5 out of 6 fields (id, description, triggers, rationale, createdAt, createdBy)
- Existing `BaseVectorService` architecture provides proven foundation for Vector DB operations
- Consistent architecture reduces maintenance overhead and ensures type safety
- Leverages existing validation, ID generation, and timestamp utilities

**Impact**: 
- Create shared base interface for common organizational entity fields
- PolicyVectorService extends existing `BaseVectorService<PolicyIntent>` pattern
- Consistent type system across organizational data types
- Shared utilities for ID generation, validation, and timestamp management

**Code Impact**: 
- Create `src/core/organizational-types.ts` with `BaseOrganizationalEntity` interface
- Refactor `OrganizationalPattern` to extend base interface
- Create `PolicyIntent` interface extending base interface
- Implement `PolicyVectorService` using existing `BaseVectorService` architecture

### Decision 9: Delete + Create Sufficient for Updates
**Date**: 2025-08-25  
**Decision**: Policy and pattern updates will use delete + create workflow instead of dedicated update operations  
**Rationale**: 
- Functionally equivalent to dedicated update operations - users achieve same end result
- Simpler architecture without complex synchronization logic between old/new versions
- Both delete and create operations already work reliably and are well-tested
- Vector DB semantic search works identically regardless of update method
- Clean slate approach avoids potential sync issues between policy intents and Kyverno policies

**Impact**: 
- Removes policy update workflow from Phase 4 requirements - Phase 4 is essentially complete
- Eliminates need for complex version management and state synchronization
- Simplifies user mental model with clear separation between delete and create operations
- Applies consistently to both patterns and policies for architectural consistency

**Code Impact**: Mark policy update workflow as deferred in Phase 4, update success criteria to reflect decision

- **Resource Overload**: Large clusters may have many applicable resources
  - *Mitigation*: Use confidence scoring to limit resource scope

### User Experience Risks
- **Policy Complexity**: Generated policies may be hard to understand
  - *Mitigation*: Clear attribution and explanation in policy annotations
- **False Positives**: AI may generate incorrect policies
  - *Mitigation*: Always require user confirmation before applying

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **Kyverno**: Required for policy enforcement

**Duration**: ~4 hours debugging + comprehensive system fixes + end-to-end validation
**Branch**: feature/prd-74-pattern-driven-policy-generation (uncommitted changes)
**Primary Focus**: Critical bug fixes for schema validation and resource name handling

**Critical Bug Discovery and Resolution**:
- **Bug**: AI generating questions for non-existent resource fields (cpu-target, memory-target on App CRD, database-name on SQL CRD)
- **Root Cause**: `generateQuestionsWithAI` only received generic resource descriptions, not actual schemas from kubectl explain
- **Investigation**: kubectl explain calls were using incorrect resource names (SQL.devopstoolkit.live vs sqls.devopstoolkit.live)
- **Impact**: Users receiving invalid configuration questions that don't match actual resource capabilities

**Completed Schema Validation Enhancements**:
- [x] **Schema Fetching Integration**: Modified `generateQuestionsWithAI` to fetch actual kubectl explain data before question generation (`src/core/schema.ts`)
- [x] **Resource Name Resolution**: Fixed kubectl explain calls to use `resourceName` field from capability data (proper plural forms)
- [x] **Error Handling**: Added clear error messages for missing resourceName fields instead of silent fallback to broken behavior
- [x] **AI Prompt Updates**: Enhanced `prompts/resource-selection.md` to instruct AI to include resourceName in resource definitions
- [x] **Response Parsing Fix**: Updated `parseSimpleSolutionResponse` to preserve resourceName from AI responses
- [x] **Test Coverage**: Updated 22 test mocks to include resourceName fields, ensuring comprehensive validation

**Technical Achievements**:
- **Zero Invalid Questions**: Questions now only generated for fields that actually exist in resource schemas
- **Robust Resource Naming**: kubectl explain calls use correct plural resource names consistently
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Clear user feedback when resource schemas cannot be fetched
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All tests pass with new validation requirements

**Live System Validation**:
- **Policy Testing**: Created Azure region policy and successfully tested database creation with policy enforcement
- **Schema Accuracy**: Generated questions match actual SQL CRD schema fields (size, region, version, databases, crossplane.compositionRef)
- **End-to-End Flow**: Complete user workflow validated from policy creation through compliant manifest generation
- **Debug Analysis**: Examined debug prompts to confirm Properties section correctly populated with actual schema data

**User Experience Improvements**:
- **Accurate Questions**: Users only see questions for fields they can actually configure
- **Clear Error Messages**: Helpful feedback when resource schemas are unavailable
- **Policy Integration**: Seamless policy enforcement with schema-accurate question generation
- **Reliable Recommendations**: Recommendations based on actual cluster capabilities, not assumptions

**Technical Impact**:
- Fixed fundamental issue where recommendation system diverged from actual resource capabilities
- Established reliable pattern for schema-driven question generation

## Appendix

### Example Policy Intent and Usage

**Policy Intent Structure**:
```typescript
{
  id: "pol_2025_01_21_resource_limits",
  description: "All containers must specify CPU and memory resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion and ensure fair scheduling across the cluster",
  triggers: ["resource limits", "cpu limits", "memory limits", "resource management"],
  rationale: "Prevents single containers from consuming all cluster resources and ensures predictable application performance",
  createdAt: "2025-01-21T10:00:00Z", 
  createdBy: "platform-team",
  
  // Added after user applies generated Kyverno policy
  deployedPolicies: [
    {
      name: "require-resource-limits-1735789200",
      appliedAt: "2025-01-21T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Policy-Enhanced Question Generation** (User: "Deploy web application"):
```yaml
# System workflow:
# 1. Finds Deployment + Service resources (patterns + capabilities)
# 2. Searches policy intents, finds resource limits policy
# 3. AI generates questions enhanced with policy requirements:

REQUIRED Questions:
  - name: "Application name"
  - cpu_limit: "CPU limit (⚠️ required by resource-limits policy)"
    default: "500m"
    hint: "Organization policy requires CPU limits on all deployments"
  - memory_limit: "Memory limit (⚠️ required by resource-limits policy)" 
    default: "512Mi"
    hint: "Organization policy requires memory limits on all deployments"

# Result: User gets compliant manifest from the start
```

**Kyverno Policy Generation**:
AI generates appropriate Kyverno ClusterPolicy YAML from the policy intent description using its knowledge of Kyverno syntax and best practices. The generated policy includes:
- Appropriate validation/mutation/generation rules based on the intent
- `background: false` to apply only to new/updated resources  
- Proper metadata with policy intent reference
- Dry-run validation ensures the policy is syntactically correct

### Technical Implementation Notes

**Shared Architecture Pattern**:
```typescript
// Base interface shared by patterns and policies
interface BaseOrganizationalEntity {
  id: string;           // Auto-generated UUID
  description: string;  // For Vector DB embedding
  triggers: string[];   // Keywords for semantic matching
  rationale: string;    // Business justification
  createdAt: string;    // ISO 8601 timestamp
  createdBy: string;    // Creator identifier
}

// PolicyIntent extends base with policy-specific fields
interface PolicyIntent extends BaseOrganizationalEntity {
  deployedPolicies?: DeployedPolicyReference[];
}

// OrganizationalPattern extends base with pattern-specific fields
interface OrganizationalPattern extends BaseOrganizationalEntity {
  suggestedResources: string[];
}
```

**Policy Intent Storage**:
```typescript
// Store policy intent only after user decision (Apply/Save/Discard)
// Include deployment status for lifecycle management
const policyIntent: PolicyIntent = {
  ...intentData,
  deployedPolicies: userApplied ? [{ name: policyName, appliedAt: now }] : undefined
};
await policyVectorService.storeIntent(policyIntent);
```

**Policy Search Integration**:
```typescript  
// Search for relevant policy intents after resource selection
const relevantPolicies = await policyVectorService.searchPolicyIntents(
  resourceContext, 
  { limit: 10 }
);
// AI incorporates policy requirements into question generation
```
