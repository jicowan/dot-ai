# PRD: Proactive In-Cluster Monitoring System

**Created**: 2025-07-28
**Status**: Complete
**Owner**: Viktor Farcic
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-05
**Completed**: 2025-10-05

## Executive Summary
Build proactive monitoring system with health checks, alerting, anomaly detection, and automated remediation for deployed applications beyond on-demand status queries.

## Documentation Changes

### Files Created/Updated
- **`docs/proactive-monitoring-guide.md`** - New File - Complete guide for continuous monitoring and alerting
- **`docs/alerting-configuration-guide.md`** - New File - Alert setup and notification configuration
- **`docs/mcp-guide.md`** - MCP Documentation - Add monitoring setup and management MCP tools
- **`README.md`** - Project Overview - Add proactive monitoring to operational capabilities
- **`src/core/monitoring/`** - Technical Implementation - Proactive monitoring system modules

### User Journey Validation
- [ ] **Primary workflow** documented end-to-end: Deploy app → Enable monitoring → Receive alerts → Auto-remediation
- [ ] **Secondary workflows** have complete coverage: Alert configuration, anomaly detection, monitoring management
- [ ] **Cross-references** between on-demand monitoring (PRD #3) and proactive monitoring work correctly

## Implementation Requirements
- [ ] **Core functionality**: Continuous monitoring with health checks and alerting
- [ ] **User workflows**: Proactive issue detection and automated remediation
- [ ] **Performance optimization**: Efficient monitoring with minimal cluster resource impact

## Work Log

### 2025-10-05: PRD Closure - Already Implemented
**Duration**: N/A (administrative closure)
**Status**: Complete

**Closure Summary**:
This PRD requested proactive Kubernetes cluster monitoring with health checks, alerting, anomaly detection, and automated remediation. **Core functionality (~60-70%) is already implemented** by the separate [dot-ai-controller](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai-controller) project.

**Implementation Evidence**:
The dot-ai-controller is a Kubernetes controller that bridges cluster events with AI-powered remediation using the DevOps AI Toolkit's MCP server.

**Functionality Delivered**:
- **Continuous monitoring** - Event-based monitoring via Kubernetes event watching (pod failures, crashes, scheduling issues)
- **Intelligent alerting** - Slack notifications with detailed AI analysis and remediation results
- **Automated remediation** - Automatic/manual modes with configurable confidence thresholds and risk levels
- **AI-powered analysis** - Claude integration via MCP for intelligent event analysis and fix generation
- **Policy-based configuration** - RemediationPolicy CRD for configuring event filters and remediation behavior
- **Rate limiting** - Prevention of event storms with cooldown periods
- **Status tracking** - Comprehensive logging of remediation actions

**Key Implementation Details**:
- **Architecture**: Kubernetes controller + dot-ai MCP service + Slack notifications
- **Event filtering**: By event type, reason, and involved object kind
- **Remediation modes**: Automatic (AI fixes without intervention) and Manual (AI recommendations for approval)
- **Confidence thresholds**: Configurable (default 0.8-0.85) to control auto-remediation
- **Use cases**: Pod scheduling failures, OOMKilled events, missing PVCs, infrastructure issues

**Not Implemented** (advanced features, deferred to future PRD):
- **Continuous metrics monitoring** - Prometheus-style metrics scraping and analysis (event-based only)
- **Predictive analytics** - Baseline behavior learning and deviation detection
- **Multi-channel alerting** - Email, webhooks, PagerDuty (Slack only currently)
- **Historical analysis** - Long-term trend analysis and pattern recognition

**Gap Analysis**:
The dot-ai-controller provides **event-driven reactive monitoring** (responds to Kubernetes events) rather than **continuous proactive monitoring** (metrics polling). This covers the majority of critical operational needs:
- ✅ Real-time issue detection and response
- ✅ AI-powered problem diagnosis
- ✅ Automated or guided remediation
- ⚠️ Missing: Metrics-based alerting (CPU, memory, disk)
- ⚠️ Missing: Predictive issue detection

**Future Considerations**:
Advanced features like continuous metrics monitoring and predictive analytics can be addressed in a new PRD that extends the remediation system to incorporate Prometheus/OpenTelemetry metrics and observability data not available in Kubernetes API events.

### 2025-07-28: PRD Refactoring to Documentation-First Format
**Completed Work**: Refactored PRD #20 to follow new documentation-first guidelines with comprehensive proactive monitoring features.
