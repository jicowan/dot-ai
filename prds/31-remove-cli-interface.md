# PRD: Remove CLI Interface - MCP-Only Architecture

**Created**: 2025-07-22
**Status**: Draft
**Owner**: Viktor Farcic
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-22

## Executive Summary
Simplify the DevOps AI Toolkit architecture by removing the CLI interface entirely, maintaining only the MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface. This eliminates code duplication, reduces maintenance overhead, and focuses the project on its core strength as an AI development tool integration.

## Problem Statement
The current architecture maintains two parallel interfaces (CLI and MCP) that provide identical functionality:

**Current Pain Points:**
- **Code Duplication**: Both interfaces essentially wrap the same core functionality, creating redundant code paths
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Bug fixes, feature updates, and testing require work in two places
- **User Confusion**: Having two interfaces with identical capabilities creates unnecessary decision paralysis
- **Complex Testing**: Test coverage needs to validate both interfaces, increasing test suite complexity
- **Documentation Burden**: All features need documentation for both CLI and MCP usage patterns

**Business Impact:**
- Development velocity is reduced by maintaining dual interfaces
- Quality risks from potential inconsistencies between interfaces  
- Resource allocation inefficiency maintaining duplicate interface code
- The MCP interface is the primary differentiator and strategic advantage
- **No current user impact** - Project is pre-general-availability, allowing clean architectural decisions

## Proposed Solution
**Remove all CLI interface components** while preserving 100% of core functionality through the MCP interface:

**Core Approach:**
- Remove `src/interfaces/cli.ts` and all CLI command handling
- **Carefully preserve shared core functions** - Many functions in `src/core/` are used by both interfaces
- Remove CLI-specific tests while preserving core function tests
- Remove CLI binary and packaging configuration  
- Keep MCP interface as the single point of access utilizing existing core functions
- Update documentation to focus exclusively on MCP workflows

**Key Benefits:**
- **Simplified Architecture**: Single interface, single code path, single truth
- **Faster Development**: Features only need implementation in one place
- **Better Focus**: Concentrate on MCP integration excellence rather than interface proliferation
- **Reduced Testing**: Half the interface testing while maintaining full functionality coverage
- **Clearer Value Proposition**: Position as premium AI development tool integration

## User Stories & Use Cases

**Development Team (Primary Beneficiary):**
- As a **developer**, I want **single interface maintenance** so that I can **focus on feature development rather than interface synchronization**  
- As a **contributor**, I want **simplified codebase architecture** so that I can **easily understand and contribute to the project**

**Future MCP Users (Enhanced Experience):**
- As an **AI development tool user**, I want **focused MCP documentation** so that I can **quickly understand all available capabilities**
- As a **contributor**, I want **simplified codebase architecture** so that I can **easily understand and contribute to the project**

**Maintainers:**
- As a **project maintainer**, I want **single interface maintenance** so that I can **focus on feature development rather than interface synchronization**
- As a **maintainer**, I want **streamlined testing** so that I can **confidently release updates faster**
