**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Owner**: Viktor Farcic
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-06
**GitHub Issue**: [#150](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/150)
**Priority**: Medium
**Complexity**: High
**Related PRDs**: [#143 - Tool-Based Remediation (Phase 1)](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/blob/main/prds/143-tool-based-remediation-observability.md)

## Executive Summary

Extend the remediation tool with observability data source tools (metrics, traces, alerts) to enable comprehensive issue analysis beyond kubectl-based investigation. This builds on the tool-based architecture established in PRD #143 Phase 1.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations

The remediation tool successfully uses kubectl-based tools for cluster state investigation but lacks access to:
- **Historical metrics** (CPU/memory trends over time)
- **Performance data** (latency, throughput, error rates)
- **Observability platforms** (monitoring alerts, trace data)
- **Custom metrics** (application-specific measurements)

### Real-World Impact

**Example Scenario**: Pod crashes with OOMKilled
- **Current behavior**: AI sees "OOMKilled" event, recommends increasing memory limit
- **Missing context**:
  - Actual memory usage patterns over last hour
  - Whether memory was growing steadily or spiked suddenly
  - Memory utilization across all replicas
  - Any correlated alerts or incidents

**Result**: User must manually:
- Check Prometheus/DataDog/Grafana after AI analysis
- Correlate metrics with Kubernetes events
- Make remediation decisions without complete picture
- Run multiple tools to get full understanding

---

## Solution Overview

Extend remediation investigation with observability tools following the architecture pattern established for kubectl tools in PRD #143.

### Design Principles

1. **Reuse existing architecture**: Follow the pattern from `src/core/kubectl-tools.ts`:
   - Tool definitions using `AITool` interface
   - Tool executor function with switch statement
   - Tool collection array for passing to `toolLoop()`

2. **User-configurable**: Let users choose which observability tools to enable via server configuration

3. **AI-driven selection**: AI autonomously decides when to use observability vs kubectl based on issue type

4. **Provider-agnostic**: Works with both Anthropic and Vercel AI SDK providers

### Tools to Be Determined

During implementation, we'll research and select which observability tools to integrate. Candidates include:
- **Metrics platforms**: Prometheus, DataDog, Grafana, New Relic
- **Tracing systems**: Jaeger, Tempo, OpenTelemetry
- **Log aggregation**: Loki, Elasticsearch, Splunk
- **Alert systems**: Alertmanager, PagerDuty

The specific tools and their priority will be decided based on:
- User demand and common use cases
- Integration complexity
- API availability and stability
- Maintenance burden

---

## User Journey

### Before (Kubectl-Only)
```
1. User: "My pods keep restarting"
2. AI calls kubectl tools → sees OOMKilled events
3. AI: "Pods restarting due to OOMKilled - increase memory limit"
4. User manually checks Prometheus for actual memory usage
5. User discovers memory spikes to 450Mi, limit is 512Mi
6. User implements fix based on combined data
```

### After (With Observability Integration)
```
1. User: "My pods keep restarting"
2. AI calls kubectl_describe → sees OOMKilled events
3. AI calls observability tool → sees memory peaks at 450Mi consistently
4. AI calls observability tool → sees memory request set to 128Mi
5. AI analyzes: "Memory peaks at 450Mi, limit is 512Mi, but requests too low"
6. AI: "Set memory request=256Mi, limit=512Mi based on actual usage"
7. User applies fix with complete confidence

(Complete analysis without manual correlation)
```

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Pattern (Already Established)

From PRD #143, we have this proven pattern:

**Tool Definition**:
```typescript
// src/core/kubectl-tools.ts
export const KUBECTL_GET_TOOL: AITool = {
  name: 'kubectl_get',
  description: 'Get Kubernetes resources...',
  inputSchema: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: { ... },
    required: ['resource']
  }
};
```

**Tool Executor**:
```typescript
export async function executeKubectlTools(toolName: string, input: any) {
  switch (toolName) {
    case 'kubectl_get':
      // Execute and return result
      return { success: true, data: output };
    default:
      return { success: false, error: 'Unknown tool' };
  }
}
```

**Tool Collection**:
```typescript
export const KUBECTL_INVESTIGATION_TOOLS: AITool[] = [
  KUBECTL_GET_TOOL,
  KUBECTL_DESCRIBE_TOOL,
  // ... more tools
];
```

**Integration with Remediation**:
```typescript
// src/tools/remediate.ts
import { KUBECTL_INVESTIGATION_TOOLS, executeKubectlTools } from '../core/kubectl-tools';

// Use in toolLoop()
const result = await aiProvider.toolLoop({
  systemPrompt,
  tools: KUBECTL_INVESTIGATION_TOOLS,
  executeFunction: executeKubectlTools
});
```

### Observability Tools (To Be Designed)

Following the same pattern, we'll create:

```typescript
// src/core/observability-tools.ts (to be created)

export const OBSERVABILITY_TOOL_1: AITool = {
  name: 'tool_name_tbd',
  description: 'Query observability data...',
  inputSchema: { /* TBD during implementation */ }
};

export async function executeObservabilityTools(toolName: string, input: any) {
  switch (toolName) {
    case 'tool_name_tbd':
      // Implementation TBD
      return { success: true, data: result };
    default:
      return { success: false, error: 'Unknown tool' };
  }
}

export const OBSERVABILITY_INVESTIGATION_TOOLS: AITool[] = [
  // Tools TBD during implementation
];
```

### Configuration System

Server-level configuration for enabling/disabling observability tools:

```typescript
// Environment variables (example pattern)
OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED=true
OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER_1_ENABLED=true
OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER_1_URL=https://...
OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER_1_API_KEY=xxx

// Runtime tool selection
const investigationTools = [
  ...KUBECTL_INVESTIGATION_TOOLS,
  ...(config.observabilityEnabled ? OBSERVABILITY_INVESTIGATION_TOOLS : [])
];
```

- ✅ kubectl tools pattern established and proven
- ⏳ Access to observability endpoints for testing
- ⏳ API keys for observability platforms

### Internal Dependencies
- ✅ AIProvider interface with tool support

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Observability API rate limits | High | Medium | Implement caching, request throttling |
| Unreliable external APIs | Medium | Medium | Graceful fallbacks, timeout handling |
| Increased complexity | Medium | High | Follow established pattern, good docs |
| Authentication challenges | Medium | Medium | Support multiple auth methods |
| Integration maintenance | High | Medium | Start with most stable/popular platforms |

---

## Out of Scope

- **NOT building observability platforms**: We integrate with existing platforms, don't replace them
- **NOT creating custom metrics**: We query existing metrics only
- **NOT modifying observability configurations**: Read-only access to observability data
- **NOT including all possible platforms**: Focus on most common/requested tools

---

## Open Questions

1. **Q**: Which observability tools should we prioritize first?
   **A**: TBD - will research during Milestone 1

2. **Q**: Should configuration be per-MCP-call or server-level?
   **A**: Server-level (decided in PRD #143) - users configure once, applies to all investigations

3. **Q**: How do we handle observability API costs?
   **A**: TBD - may need usage monitoring and rate limiting

4. **Q**: Should we support on-premise vs cloud observability?
   **A**: TBD - depends on selected tools and user requirements
